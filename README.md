# python-api-challenge

Had some help from the ASK BCS team on thee importing and getting the api keys in the correct file.

I also had some help from some people in class with the map in the VacationPy file.

I know the code is correct for step 2,3 and 4 in the VacationPy but I have no results in my search. I think something went wrong in my weatherPy file, specifically during the linear regressions. Because when I was narrowing the criteria search in step 2 that is where no results first appear.

In step 5 for vacationPY I am not sure how to fix that error either.

I tried to comment everything I could and the results of the correlations/R_values for weatherPy as well.
